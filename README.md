## CmdPlus is a new command management plugin!
### Check it out on [BuildByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/cmdplus.58077/)

### Features:
 - **[CmdAliases:](https://github.com/JuliusH1/CmdPlus/wiki/CmdAlias)** Create custom aliases for commands in the aliases.yml with permissions!
 - **[CmdSigns:](https://github.com/JuliusH1/CmdPlus/wiki/CmdSigns)** Create signs that run commands when right-clicked! 

### Commands:
- **/cmdplus reload <all/config/alias/sign>:** reloads the config/alias/sign or all of the plugin!
- **/cmdalias <create/list> <alias> <command> <permission>:** Create a alias ingame with permission or view the list of aliases!
- **/trash or /bin** open a chest gui were you can put blocks in and close it to dispose them!
- **/privatechest** open a private chest were you can store items!
- 
### Permissions:
- **CmdSigns:** cmdsign.use to create signs and cmdsign.edit to edit.
- **CmdAliases:** commandalias.use.<alias> to use this alias. You can set this to something else but I recommend using commandalias.use.<youralias> .
