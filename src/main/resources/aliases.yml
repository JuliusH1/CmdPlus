# I recommend creating aliases here and not ingame as the permissions might not always work.
# After creating a new aliases here save it and reload the plugin using /cmdplus reload alias/all

Aliases:
  example: #alias
    command: help #Performed command
    permission: commandalias.use.help #permission
  # so when someone with the permission commandalias.use.help types /example it will perform the command /help.
  spawn:
    command: warp spawn
    permission: commandalias.use.spawn
  greet:
    command: say Hello, everyone!
    permission: commandalias.use.greet
  crates:
    command: warp crates
    permission: commandalias.use.crates
